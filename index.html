	<p style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; " >  <big>Karnali is an old & aborigine khas civilization in Nepal and is
		 connected with the Karnali River. Archaeological sites found in Jumla, Surkhet and Dailekh infer that the area was part of the old Khasa kingdom which was
		 established during the 8th century. The capital of the Khas Kingdom was Sinja in present-day Jumla District. The kingdom expanded to a great extent in the
		 <b> 13th</b> and<b> 14th</b> century; expanding to Garhwal in the west, Mansarowar and Guge regions of Tibet in the north, Trishuli River in the east and
		  Kapilvastu with large areas of Terai in the south. After the late <b>14th century,</b> the Khas empire collapsed and was divided into the Baise Rajya
		  <b> (22 principalities) </b>in Karnali-Bheri region & Chaubisi Rajya <b>(24 principalities)</b> in Gandaki .<br><br>

		Before the unification of modern Nepal, a part of Karnali (from Karnali River to Bheri River)
		was in the Sanghiya Baise Rajya <b>(22 principality confederacy)</b>. The principalities were sovereign but intermittently
		allied among themselves until they were annexed during the unification of modern Nepal from <b>1744</b> to<b> 1810.</b></p>
