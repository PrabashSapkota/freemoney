<p style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; " > <big>The history of Mugu dates back to ancient times, and the region is believed to have been inhabited since the Stone Age. The district was originally a part of the Malla Kingdom, which was divided into several principalities in the 15th century. Mugu was one of these principalities, ruled by the Sen Dynasty. The kingdom was later annexed by the Gorkha Kingdom in the late 18th century, and Mugu became a part of Nepal.
During the Nepalese Civil War (1996-2006), Mugu was a stronghold of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). The conflict resulted in the loss of many lives and the displacement of many people in the district.</p>
