										<h1 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">History</h1>
										<p style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; " > <big>The history of Jumla dates back to ancient times, and the region is believed to have been inhabited since the Stone Age. Archaeological evidence suggests that Jumla was once part of the Khasa Kingdom, which was established in the 8th century.
										The district was originally a part of the Malla Kingdom, which was divided into several principalities in the 15th century. Jumla was one of these principalities, ruled by the Sen Dynasty. The kingdom was later annexed by the Gorkha Kingdom in the late 18th century, and Jumla became a part of Nepal.
										During the Nepalese Civil War (1996-2006), Jumla was a stronghold of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). The conflict resulted in the loss of many lives and the displacement of many people in the district.</p>
